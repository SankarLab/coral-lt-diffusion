Official implementation of "CORAL: Disentangling Latent Representations in Long-Tailed Diffusion", NeurIPS 2025. Diffusion models struggle with long-tailed distributions, producing low-quality samples for underrepresented classes due to latent representation overlap. CORAL addresses this through contrastive regularization in the U-Net latent space, using a supervised contrastive losse, significantly improving quality and diversity of tail-class samples.
